    "This notebook uses a collection of clinical case reports to cluster words by topics using the NMF method. To cluster text we need to preprocess the text first with regular natural language processing cleaning steps such as remove punctuations, stopwords, or other unwanted text. we lower the text and use the lemma to reduce variation of words. This is all done in part A. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to prepare the text in a document term matrix so that NMF can perform the calculations. The Document-Term Matrix (DTM) represents the frequency of words (or terms) in a collection of documents. Each row in the matrix represents a document, and each column represents a word in the vocabulary. The value in each cell represents the frequency of the corresponding word in the corresponding document. This is done in part B\n",
