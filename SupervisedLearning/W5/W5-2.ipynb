    "2. Model Evaluation\n",

    "Classification metrics are important for measuring the performance of your model. Scikit-learn provides several options such as the classification_report and confusion_matrix functions. Another helpful option is the AUC ROC and precision-recall curve. Try to understand what these metrics mean and give arguments why one metric would be more important then others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you have to predict whether a patient has cancer or not, the number of false negatives is probably more important than the number of false positives. This would be different if we were predicting whether a picture contains a cat or a dog – or not: it all depends on the context. Thus, it is important to understand when to use which metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you can use your own dataset if that is eligable for supervised classification. Otherwise, you can use the breast cancer dataset which you can find on assemblix2019 (/data/datasets/DS3/). Go through the data science pipeline as you've done before:\n",
